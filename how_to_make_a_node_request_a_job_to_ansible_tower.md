# Two way of pull mode in ansible
In most of case, ansible's push mode is enough to automate a job. but sometimes pull mode is needed to deal with huge amount of nodes.
then, what is the pull mode and push mode?
- push mode: ansible's default architecture which push commands to managed nodes and triger it to action.
- pull mode: chef and puppet's default architecture which each agent fetches the command from control node and execute it.

Traditionally Ansible is run in "push" mode where Ansible playbooks are run from a well known machine or from local machine and this, in turn, makes changes on remote machines as per the inventory.

So I'll show you the two way of pull mode feature. 
  1. ansible-pull
  1. ansible tower's callback.
## ansible-pull
1. create git repo for ansible playbook repository
1. write down sample playbook to execute
  - filename: ansible-pull.yml
```yaml
---
- name: ansible pull sample
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  tasks:
    - name: print message
      debug:
        msg: "print ansible pull"
    - name: create text file to verify the action
      copy:
        content: |
          this file is generated by ansible
          copy module is used
        dest: ./file_from_ansible_pull.txt
        mode: 0400
```

1. create inventory file
  - filename: hosts
```yaml
localhost connection=local
```

1. execute on node
```shell
vm> ansible-pull -d /tmp/project -U https://github.com/hatsari/ansible-pull-sample.git -i /tmp/project/hosts ansible-pull.yml

1. verify result
```
cat /tmp/project/file_from_ansible_pull.txt
----
this file is generated by ansible
copy module is used

## ansible tower's callback
